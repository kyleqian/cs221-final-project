Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah
Baby and that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
Your saint sure got us the cutest, the hottest masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace
And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Well if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
Baby I could die a happy man
Baby I could die a happy man
Don't you know baby
Life was great,
Wouldn't change a thing,
I had it all but with you I had more,
But out of nowhere out of the blue,
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling.
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind,
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind.
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober
I'm on the floor cursing at the door
Broken hearted with a pounding head
And I know I got to let you go
So the liquor helps me forget,
Your name, Your face
This pain I can't erase
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind,
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind.
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober
Now you're gone, You moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind,
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind.
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober 
Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Lets whisper, let’s don’t talk
Baby, leave my T-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove,
Baby, we’ll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction,
It’s time we made it happen
Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain’t holdin’ nothin’ these two hands
Until they’re holding you again
Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
I don’t wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So lets close our eyes
And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside, I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone
I've been sleepwalking, been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broken and make it right
I've been sleepwalking too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house
See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone
I've been sleepwalking, been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broken and make it right
I've been sleepwalking too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house
The flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh, and I don't wanna wake up
In this burning house
I've been sleepwalking, been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broken and make it right
I've been sleepwalking too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house
I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...
...she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, she just didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...
...she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
Your mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, "... that guy!" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...
...she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
Hey girl, what'sup?
I know it's late, but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought what harm could come from one little call?
I know you say you're taken, but I say girl you're talking too long
Tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
I know, you don't wanna break his heart, but that ain't no good reason to be keeping us apart look,
just tell him, it's you, it ain't him,
and maybe you can lie to him and say you'll still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him that you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I kinda fit like a glove
So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
It ain't my business to be all up in, but I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
I know that you so done with him, break up with him, break up with him
You would've hung up by now if you weren't thinking it too
No pressure, whatever, just do what you gotta do, but if I was you
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Just rip it off like a band-aid
Yeah, I know I said it, but I'll say it again, I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend,
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
Just break up with him
We say goodbye see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up we make up and we make love
We can’t seem to let go girl
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
I’m all alone, but you’re on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you’re at home
Who knows what we are in the mornin'
All I know is I want you
Repeat Chorus
Yeah we said that we’re done and I know that it’s late
But you already know, I’m on my way
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire that’s burnin'
She's a small-town, hard-working woman just trying to make a living
Working three jobs, feeding four little mouths in a run-down kitchen
When you never taking nothing and doing nothing but giving
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian
She said, "I don't drink"
"But sometimes I need a stiff drink"
"Sipping from a high, full glass"
"Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke"
"But sometimes I need a long drag"
"Yeah, I know it might sound bad"
"But sometimes I need a smoke break"
He's a big-city, hard-working man just trying to climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of driving a tractor
Never had nothing handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son, do something good that matters
He said, "I don't drink"
"But sometimes I wanna pop that top"
"Take a swig and make the world stop"
"And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke"
"But sometimes I wanna light it up"
"Yeah, when things get tough"
"Sometimes I need a smoke break, yeah"
So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off
I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a high, full glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a
When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup,
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go
I ain’t rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog, ain’t working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that’d kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says money can’t buy happiness
But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some Silver Bullets
Yeah, I know what they say, money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so, but it can buy me a boat
They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing money is the root of all evils
And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I’m sure that’s probably true, but it still sounds pretty cool
‘Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, I know what they say, money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so, but it can buy me a boat
To float down on the water with a beer…
I hear the Powerball is sitting’ on a hundred mill…
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reel…
It could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some Silver Bullets
Yeah, I know what they say, money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so, but it could buy me a boat
Yeah, I know what they say, money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so, but it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a boat.
