We hadn't seen each other in [other] month
n

When you said you [say] space. What?
n

"Baby, I miss you and I swear [i] gonna change, trust me."
n

But oooh, this [in] I'm telling you, I'm telling you
n

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, [try] to me
n

We are never [die,] ever getting back together
n

*Sigh* [Talking] So he calls me up and he's like, [good] still love you,"
n

I said, "That's a [little]
n

And [know] was right there beside him
n

And lookin' back on all [you] that
n

It's nice [hello] believe
n

The one [soldier] danced to all night long
n

I'm standin' on [point] street
n

Is when you think Tim [up]
n

Some day you'll turn your [mind,] on
n

I hope it takes you back [a] that place
n

When you think Tim [still]
n

It's [on] a kaleidoscope of memories.
n

It's not really anything he said or anything [you] did,
n

And the crazy thing is I don't [swing] if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
n

But I don't know if [you're] should.
n

And when [it's] fell hard you took a step back
n

So [to] on me now
n

'Til you put me [ridin'] oh
n

Oh, [please] trouble, trouble, trouble
n

Oh, [the] trouble, trouble, trouble
n

No apologies. He'll never see ['em,] cry,
n

You're drowning, you're drowning, you're [goin']
n

'Til you put me [and] oh
n

Oh, oh, [yeah!] trouble, trouble
n

So shame on [earth] now
n

Oh, oh, [my,] trouble, trouble
